Computer Vision For Object Detection

This project includes Object Detection experiments.

1. Object_Detection_With_Pretrained_YOLO_v8 - demonstrates YOLOv8 inference for object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) model of version 8 (the most state-of-the-art version at the moment) pretrained on the "ImageNet" dataset.

2. asl-alphabet-recognition - demonstrates from scratch developed CNN model architecture learned on American Sign Language (ASL) dataset particularly to recognize ASL alphabet.
